## Assignments and Grading
- **Grading Components:**
  1. Routine homework assignments (up to 12 times)
     - Homework should be done individually, though discussions with classmates, friends, and online forums are allowed.
     - No "copy-paste" from others' homework is allowed.
  2. A written mid-term exam (format not yet decided) covering derivations of machine learning algorithms.
     - NO CHEATING IS TOLERATED. Failure to comply leads to a failure in the course.
  3. (TBD) A final exam on Python programming skills.
     - NO CHEATING IS TOLERATED. Failure to comply leads to a failure in the course.
  4. A group class project (in-class presentation before the class final exam period).
     - Groups should be of 5-8 people.
- **Weighting:**
  - Attendance and Homework: 40%
  - Mid-term: 10%
  - Final: 20%
  - Group Project: 30%

## Course Policies
### Homework
- You may ask the course instructor or TA for limited help with assignments.
- Discussions with fellow students are allowed, but each individual must independently write up their own assignments.
- Properly name your homework files for easy recognition by graders.
- Each student must attach the following statement to their code:
  > I have neither given nor received unauthorized assistance on this assignment.

### Expected Classroom Behavior
- Professional behavior is expected during all interactions with fellow students, faculty, and staff.
- Arrive and leave quietly if necessary, and inform the instructor in advance if you need to leave early.
- No taping or recording is allowed.

### Late Turn-in
- No turn-ins after the homework is due will be accepted.
- The least favorable assignment out of all will be automatically dropped when calculating final scores.

### Cheating and Plagiarism
- No "copy-paste" from others' homework is allowed.
- NO CHEATING IS TOLERATED for both exams. Failure to comply leads to a failure in the course.

## University Policies
- Grades, including homework assignments and exams, cannot be modified once confirmed. Contact the TA or instructor if you have questions about your grades.
- Absence without permission is severely punished. Specifically, "在长学期连续旷一门课 6次以上（含 6次）或随机抽查点名旷课 3次以上（含 3次），取消其参加该课程的期末考试资格，成绩以 0分登记。"
- All courses must have scheduled mid-term and final exams. The final exam must be a closed-book written test. Instructors must submit a question review form and prepare two sets of questions (A and B) with no more than 20% overlap between them and with previous years' exams.
